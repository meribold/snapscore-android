# SnapScore

The SnapScore Android app.  I mean, that's what will be here once I wrote it.

## TODO

*  Why is my *Kotlin* code in a subdirectory called `java`?  Is that necessary?
*  [Load photos efficiently.][1]
*  On a Moto G4 Plus (Android 7.0, API 24) the photos we take are all available from
   Google Photos.  That's not supposed to happen.
*  The `ImageView` doesn't show any photo after returning from the camera app on a Samsung
   Galaxy S4 GT-I9500 with Android 5.0.1 (API 21).
