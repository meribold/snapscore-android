## TODO

*  Why is it that my code needs **7** subdirectories
   ([app/src/main/java/xyz/meribold/snapscore/]).  It's disgusting.  Is it possible to
   have something less awful?  Take a look at [lua][] for an example of nice project
   layout.
*  Why is my code in a subdirectory called `java`?  Is that necessary?

[app/src/main/java/xyz/meribold/snapscore/]: app/src/main/java/xyz/meribold/snapscore/
[lua]: https://github.com/lua/lua
