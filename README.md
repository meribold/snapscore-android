SnapScore automates scoring of the board game [*Take It Easy*][] using computer vision.
The user takes a photo of their game board, and SnapScore computes the score.  The Android
app was available on Google Play from 2018 to 2023, but is now discontinued.  However, a
basic web frontend backed by AWS Lambda is available at [snapscore.meribold.org][].
